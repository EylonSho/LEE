3384,ATP binding to HSP90 triggers conformation change,"the molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (hsp90) functions as a homodimer. each hsp90 protomer contains three flexibly linked regions, the n-terminal atp-binding domain (ntd), the middle domain, and the c-terminal dimerization domain. hsp90 dimer is rather a dynamic molecule and atp binding and hydrolysis are associated with conformational changes. the structures of the isolated yeast and human n-terminal domain (ntd) of hsp90 bound to atp, adp and adenylylimidodiphosphate (amp-pnp, a non-hydrolysable analogue of atp) suggest that nucleotides bind deep in the cleft of ntd in open apo state of hsp90. the structural studies of ntd of human hsp90 with antitumor agent geldanamycin (that acts as an adp/atp mimetic) support the polar interactions in the binding pocket described for yeast hsp90 and adp or atp. once atp is bound it helps to stabilize the closed atp lid state, in which the gamma-phosphate of atp provides a hydrogen bonding that promotes a stable association of the atp lid with ntd. the association of atp or amp-pnp with ntd then stimulates structural changes in ntd. nmr analysis of human full-length hsp90 protein with and without atp confirmed that atp binding led to conformational changes in ntd. no structural changes were observed in the middle and c-terminal domains. however, other studies suggest that atp-dependent conformational changes occur both in ntd and in the middle domain of hsp90. the changes are likely to involve movements of the atp lid segment within each n-terminal domain that locates over the bound atp. the movement of the lids exposes surface residues that are subsequently involved in transient dimerization of the n-terminal domains of hsp90. the subsequent conformational changes upon atp binding are regulated by co-chaperone activities. for example, arrangement of the stip1 domains in the complex seems to prevent the ntds dimerization of hsp90 monomers and total closure of the hsp90 dimer that is required for an efficient hsp90-mediated atp hydrolysis. thus, atp binding coupled to co-chaperone-mediated loading of client protein to hsp90 complex regulates atpase activity of hsp90.","{'atp', 'hsp90:stip1:hsp70:nascent protein'}",{'hsp90:atp:stip1:hsp70:nascent protein'},"{'atp', 'hsp90:atp:stip1:hsp70:nascent protein', 'hsp90:stip1:hsp70:nascent protein'}","the molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (hsp90) functions as a homodimer. each hsp90 protomer contains three flexibly linked regions, the n-terminal atp-binding domain (ntd), the middle domain, and the c-terminal dimerization domain. hsp90 dimer is rather a dynamic molecule and atp binding and hydrolysis are associated with conformational changes. the structures of the isolated yeast and human n-terminal domain (ntd) of hsp90 bound to atp, adp and adenylylimidodiphosphate (amp-pnp, a non-hydrolysable analogue of atp) suggest that nucleotides bind deep in the cleft of ntd in open apo state of hsp90. the structural studies of ntd of human hsp90 with antitumor agent geldanamycin (that acts as an adp/atp mimetic) support the polar interactions in the binding pocket described for yeast hsp90 and adp or atp. once atp is bound it helps to stabilize the closed atp lid state, in which the gamma-phosphate of atp provides a hydrogen bonding that promotes a stable association of the atp lid with ntd. the association of atp or amp-pnp with ntd then stimulates structural changes in ntd. nmr analysis of human full-length hsp90 protein with and without atp confirmed that atp binding led to conformational changes in ntd. no structural changes were observed in the middle and c-terminal domains. however, other studies suggest that atp-dependent conformational changes occur both in ntd and in the middle domain of hsp90. the changes are likely to involve movements of the atp lid segment within each n-terminal domain that locates over the bound atp. the movement of the lids exposes surface residues that are subsequently involved in transient dimerization of the n-terminal domains of hsp90. the subsequent conformational changes upon atp binding are regulated by co-chaperone activities. for example, arrangement of the stip1 domains in the complex seems to prevent the ntds dimerization of hsp90 monomers and total closure of the hsp90 dimer that is required for an efficient hsp90-mediated atp hydrolysis. thus, atp binding coupled to co-chaperone-mediated loading of client protein to hsp90 complex regulates atpase activity of hsp90."

5286,Beta-catenin:TCF associates with BCL9 and PYGO,"once tethered at wnt promoters, beta-catenin is a scaffold for the recruitment of a variety of transcriptional activators. the c-terminal end of beta-catenin interacts with a wide range of general transcriptional activators and chromatin remodelers, while the n-terminal region recruits more wnt-specific activators including bcl9 and pygopus. bcl9 proteins (2 in vertebrates, bcl9 and bcl9l) interact with both beta-catenin and the putative activator pygo (also 2 in vertebrates, pygo1 and pygo2) and in this way function as a bridging molecule to promote wnt-dependent transcription. bcl9 was identified as the gene overexpressed in a b cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line and was subsequently found to be homologous to legless (lgs), a drosophila gene identified in a number of screens for components of the wnt signalling pathway. lgs and bcl9 have no recognizable protein motifs and share sequence similarity only in three short stretches of 30 amino acids termed homology domains (hd) 1-3. hd1 mediates the interaction with the n-terminal arm domain of beta-catenin while hd2 is required for the recruitment of pygo through its c-terminal plant homology domain (phd). replacement of the phd domain of pygo with the beta-catenin-interacting hd2 domain of lgs rescues the phenotype of both lgs and pygo deletion in drosophila suggesting that the primary role of lgs is the recruitment of pygo. transcriptional activation by pygo depends on the conserved tripeptide npf in the n-terminal homology domain (nhd). in drosophila, lgs is essential for wg signalling, and deletion of either lgs or pygo phenocopies armadillo (the drosophila beta-catenin homologue) null mutants. in mammals, the requirement and roles for bcl9 and pygo are both less strict and less completely understood. unlike in drosophila, disruption of the bcl9/pygo branch in mammals has less impact on transcriptional activation than abrogation of beta-catenin-dependent signalling through the c-terminal tail. ablation of pygopus genes in mice does not phenocopy with loss of wnt signaling , and disruption of the bcl9/bcl9l beta-catenin interaction results in embryonic lethality three days later than in the case of complete disruption of beta-catenin-dependent transcription. mammalian bcl9 also has pygo-independent roles in wnt signaling and has been shown to interact directly with other transcriptional co-activators such as cbp/p300 or trrap/gcn5 through its c-terminus. finally, the phd of pygo is able to bind methylated histones, which may contribute to context-specific roles of the protein.","{'bcl9', 'tcf/lef:ctnnb1', 'pygo'}",{'tcf/lef:ctnnb1:bcl9:pygo'},"{'tcf/lef:ctnnb1:bcl9:pygo', 'bcl9', 'tcf/lef:ctnnb1',
