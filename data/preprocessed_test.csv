8561,PI3 binds the bacterial surface,"peptidase inhibitor 3 (pi3) is a low-molecular-weight protein produced by epithelial and immune cells. it is secreted as a 9.9 kda precursor protein pi3(23-117)

(elafin) is a 6 kda generated via proteolytic processing of pi3(23-117), primarily by the mast cell-derived protease tryptase. both 6kda and 9.9 kda proteins of pi3 possess an antimicrobial function. the antimicrobial activity of pi3 is thought to depend on its cationic nature which allows pi3 to interact with and disrupt the membranes of target organisms. in vitro, pi3 protected human cells against two major respiratory pathogens, the gram-negative pseudomonas aeruginosa and gram-positive staphylococcus aureus. in vivo, pi3 also protected murine lungs against the injurious effects of both bacterial pathogens. in addition to the above-mentioned pathogens pi3 showed bactericidal activity in vitro against klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis and branhamella catarrhalis. furthermore pi3 possesses potent fungicidal activity against aspergillus fumigatus and candida albicans, which have preferential tropism for human lung tissue and other mucosae. pi3 has also been shown to possess antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) and herpes simplex virus 2 (hsv2). the mechanism of antiviral activity remains to be clarified. besides microbicidal activity, pi3 proteins can function as inhibitors of peptidase activity of human neutrophil elastase and proteinase 3 through the wap domain. the

2987,"Collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylase converts 4-Hyp collagen to 3,4-Hyp collagen","collagen contains (2s,3s)-3-hydroxyproline (3-hyp), though much less abundantly than 4-hyp. the 3-hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states. it is more prevalent in type iv and v collagens at 10-15 3-hyp residues than in type i-iii fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type i collagen has 3-hyp at residue 986. 3-hyp is formed from pro in the xaa position of xaa-hyp-gly triplets. it is likely that 4-hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-hyp poor. 3-hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability. 3-hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins. it is suggested to have a role in the self-assembly of collagen supramolecular structures. 3-hyp is formed by prolyl 3-hydroxylase (p3h; ec 1.14.11.7), which has 3 isoforms in vertebrates. all contain an er-retention signal but vary in their tissue expression. p3h can hydroxylate prolines that precede 4-hyp residues but not those that precede an unhydroxylated proline. like p4h, p3h requires molecular oxygen, alpha-ketoglutarate, iron(ii), and ascorbate for activity. p3h1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (crtap) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin b (cypb), which is encoded by the ppib gene. lack of 3-hyp in type i and ii collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (oi)-like disease, as demonstrated by crtap and ppib knock-out mice and by mutations in human lepre1 (which encodes p3h1), crtap, and ppib. the p3h1/crtap/cypb complex has also been shown to have chaperone activity. p3h2 hydroxylates peptides derived from type iv collagen more efficiently than type i peptides and is localized to tissues that are rich in basement membrane. the effect of prolyl 3-hydroxylation on basement membrane collagens remains unknown. in this generalized reaction, all collagen subtypes are represented as having one 3-hyp residue.","{'2og', 'o2', 'prolyl 3-hydroxylases:fe2+:4-hyp collagen propeptides'}","{'co2', 'prolyl 3-hydroxylases:fe2+:3,4-hyp collagen propeptides', 'succa'}","{'2og', 'co2', 'prolyl 3-hydroxylases:fe2+:3,4-hyp collagen propeptides', 'succa', 'o2', 'prolyl 3-hydroxylases:fe2+:4-hyp collagen propeptides'}","collagen contains (2s,3s)-3-hydroxyproline (3-hyp), though much less abundantly than 4-hyp. the 3-hyp content of collagen is much more variable than that of 4-hyp, varying between collagen types, tissues, developmental stages and pathological states. it is more prevalent in type iv and v collagens at 10-15 3-hyp residues than in type i-iii fibrillar collagens which have a single 3-hyp residue per chain; the alpha-1 chain of type i collagen has 3-hyp at residue 986. 3-hyp is formed from pro in the xaa position of xaa-hyp-gly triplets. it is likely that 4-hyp is a requirement at the second position of the triplet as 4-hyp rich substrates are more active than 4-hyp poor. 3-hyp has a modest effect on triple-helix stability. 3-hyp may adjust the stability of basement membranes to enable formation of the meshwork structure, or serve as a ligand for other proteins. it is suggested to have a role in the self-assembly of collagen supramolecular structures. 3-hyp is formed by prolyl 3-hydroxylase (p3h; ec 1.14.11.7), which has 3 isoforms in vertebrates. all contain an er-retention signal but vary in their tissue expression. p3h can hydroxylate prolines that precede 4-hyp residues but not those that precede an unhydroxylated proline. like p4h, p3h requires molecular o2, 2og, iron(ii), and ascorbate for activity. p3h1 is homologous to mammalian leprecan or growth suppressor 1 (gros1), and forms a 3-prolyl hydroxylation complex with cartilage-associated protein (crtap) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase, cyclophilin b (cypb), which is encoded by the ppib gene. lack of 3-hyp in type i and ii collagens leads to an osteogenesis imperfecta (oi)-like disease, as demonstrated by crtap and ppib knock-out mice and by mutations in human lepre1 (which encodes p3h1), crtap, and ppib. the p3h1/crtap/cypb complex has also been shown to have chaperone activity. p3h2 hydroxylates peptides derived from type iv collagen more efficiently than type i peptides and is localized to tissues that are rich in basement membrane. the effect of prolyl 3-hydroxylation on basement membrane collagens remains unknown. in this generalized reaction, all collagen subtypes are represented as having one 3-hyp residue."

4886,NGF homodimer binds to p75NTR,"p75ntr exists in a multimeric form both in presence or absence of ngf. in the ngf:p75ntr complex, a single p75 molecule is asymmetrically bound to a ngf homodimer, along the homodimeric interface of ngf. this causes an allosteric conformational change, which disables the ngf symmetry-related second p75 binding site. therefore, it is possible that ngf has to perturb or alter the preformed p75 dimer orientation in order to initiate intracellular signalling. ngf:p75ntr complexes are not so long living as the ngf:trka complexes. this is due, at least in part, to the fact that trka homodimers are internalized, and continue signalling in endosomes. contrary to what is commonly believed, ngf bind to p75ntr and trka, individually, with a similar equilibrium binding constant (kd ~ 1-2 nm). as a matter of fact, the association constant for ngf binding to p75ntr (k+1 = 8x10 to power of 6 m-1 s-1) is faster than for trka (k+1 = 8x10 to power of 5 m-1 s-1). on the other hand, the off rate of the ngf:trka complex ( k-1 = 7.2x10 to power of -5 s-1) is much slower than the ngf:p75ntr complex (k-1 = 1x10 to power of -3 s-1). p75ntr and trk receptors functionally interact, but the precise means by which this occurs has remained unresolved. this could result from a direct physical interaction or be explained by convergent signalling of these two receptors. co-expression of both p75ntr and trka at the cell surface appears to result in the formation of a ÛÏhigh-affinityÛ binding site that has an accelerated rate of ngf association and a 30- to 100-fold higher affinity for ngf (kd ~ 1-3 x 10 to power of -11 m) than either receptor alone. the high-affinity binding sites appear to constitute 10%-15% of the total ngf binding sites. the nature of such high affinity binding sites is still unclear. they could be due to a multimeric complex of p75:trka proteins. alternatively, ngf might first rapidly bind to p75ntr and then be presented to trka in a conformation that lowers its trka association rate. some authors even question the existence of these high affinity sites. structural data on ngf complexes with p75ntr and trka extracellular domains suggest that formation of a ternary complex trka:ngf:p75ntr in a 1:2:1 ration is theoretically possible, although unlikely. however, biochemical data so far failed to show that this complex forms.","{'ngfr', 'mature beta-ngf homodimer'}",{'mature ngf homodimer:p75ntr'},"{'ngfr', 'mature beta-ngf homodimer', 'mature ngf homodimer:p75ntr'}","ngfr exists in a multimeric form both in presence or absence of ngf. in the ngf:ngfr complex, a single p75 molecule is asymmetrically bound to a ngf homodimer, along the homodimeric interface of ngf. this causes an allosteric conformational change, which disables the ngf symmetry-related second p75 binding site. therefore, it is possible that ngf has to perturb or alter the preformed p75 dimer orientation in order to initiate intracellular signalling. ngf:ngfr complexes are not so long living as the ngf:trka complexes. this is due, at least in part, to the fact that trka homodimers are internalized, and continue signalling in endosomes. contrary to what is commonly believed, ngf bind to ngfr and trka, individually, with a similar equilibrium binding constant (kd ~ 1-2 nm). as a matter of fact, the association constant for ngf binding to ngfr (k+1 = 8x10 to power of 6 m-1 s-1) is faster than for trka (k+1 = 8x10 to power of 5 m-1 s-1). on the other hand, the off rate of the ngf:trka complex ( k-1 = 7.2x10 to power of -5 s-1) is much slower than the ngf:ngfr complex (k-1 = 1x10 to power of -3 s-1). ngfr and trk receptors functionally interact, but the precise means by which this occurs has remained unresolved. this could result from a direct physical interaction or be explained by convergent signalling of these two receptors. co-expression of both ngfr and trka at the cell surface appears to result in the formation of a ÛÏhigh-affinityÛ binding site that has an accelerated rate of ngf association and a 30- to 100-fold higher affinity for ngf (kd ~ 1-3 x 10 to power of -11 m) than either receptor alone. the high-affinity binding sites appear to constitute 10%-15% of the total ngf binding sites. the nature of such high affinity binding sites is still unclear. they could be due to a multimeric complex of p75:trka proteins. alternatively, ngf might first rapidly bind to ngfr and then be presented to trka in a conformation that lowers its trka association rate. some authors even question the existence of these high affinity sites. structural data on ngf complexes with ngfr and trka extracellular domains suggest that formation of a ternary complex trka:ngf:ngfr in a 1:2:1 ration is theoretically possible, although unlikely. however, biochemical data so far failed to show that this complex forms."

5912,FRAT proteins bind GSK3beta,"the frat genes, which were initially identified as a target of frequent rearrangement in advanced t-cell lymphoma, encode potent activators of canonical wnt signaling and are highly conserved in vertebrates. xenopus and zebrafish each have one frat gene, while the human and mouse genomes contains two and three, respectively. frat proteins activate wnt signaling by binding to gsk3beta and inhibiting its phosphorylation of beta-catenin. the interaction with gsk3beta is mediated by a highly conserved ikea box in the c-terminal domain of frat. this region of frat is able to compete with axin for binding to gsk3beta, suggesting a model where frat is able to destabilize the destruction complex by abrogating the gsk3beta-axin interaction. this model is supported by structural studies showing that axin and frat bind to the same region on the surface of gsk3beta. endogenous frat1 has also been shown to interact with dvl3, and this reaction persists in a frat1 mutant lacking the gsk3beta-interacting domain. frat proteins may thus help bridge between gsk3betaÛªs role in the destruction complex and its role in activating signaling in response to wnt. despite the apparent importance of frat proteins in beta-catenin-dependent signaling, a triple frat knockout mouse shows no readily evident defects in canonical signaling and, unlike the gbp knockout in xenopus, no overt phenotypic defects. the in vivo role and significance of the frat proteins in wnt signaling remains to be resolved; it is worth noting, however, that frat proteins have also recently been shown to be involved in non-canonical wnt signaling in a gsk3beta-independent manner. it is possible that it is through this non-canonical role that frat proteins contribute to oncogenesis.","{'gsk3b', 'frat1,2'}","{'frat1,2:gsk3beta'}","{'gsk3b', 'frat1,2', 'frat1,2:gsk3beta'}","the frat genes, which were initially identified as a target of frequent rearrangement in advanced t-cell lymphoma, encode potent activators of canonical wnt signaling and are highly conserved in vertebrates. xenopus and zebrafish each have one frat gene, while the human and mouse genomes contains two and three, respectively. frat proteins activate wnt signaling by binding to gsk3beta and inhibiting its phosphorylation of beta-catenin. the interaction with gsk3beta is mediated by a highly conserved ikea box in the c-terminal domain of frat. this region of frat is able to compete with axin for binding to gsk3beta, suggesting a model where frat is able to destabilize the destruction complex by abrogating the gsk3beta-axin interaction. this model is supported by structural studies showing that axin and frat bind to the same region on the surface of gsk3beta. endogenous frat1 has also been shown to interact with dvl3, and this reaction persists in a frat1 mutant lacking the gsk3beta-interacting domain. frat proteins may thus help bridge between gsk3betaÛªs role in the destruction complex and its role in activating signaling in response to wnt. despite the apparent importance of frat proteins in beta-catenin-dependent signaling, a triple frat knockout mouse shows no readily evident defects in canonical signaling and, unlike the gbp knockout in xenopus, no overt phenotypic defects. the in vivo role and significance of the frat proteins in wnt signaling remains to be resolved; it is worth noting, however, that frat proteins have also recently been shown to be involved in non-canonical wnt signaling in a gsk3beta-independent manner. it is possible that it is through this non-canonical role that frat proteins contribute to oncogenesis."

3756,TNFAIP3 (A20) ubiquitinates RIPK1 with K48-linked Ub chains ,"tnfaip3 (a20) is ubiquitin-editing enzyme with distinct peptidase and ligase domains. the amino-terminal domain of tnfaip3 (a20), which is a de-ubiquitinating (dub) enzyme of the otu (ovarian tumour) family, removes k63-linked ubiquitin chains from adaptor proteins such as receptor interacting protein 1 (ripk1). the carboxy-terminal domain of tnfaip3 (a20), composed of seven c2/c2 zinc fingers, functions as a ubiquitin ligase by polyubiquitinating target proteins with k48-linked ubiquitin chains, thereby targeting them for proteasomal degradation. tnfaip3 zinc fingers have been also shown to support tnfaip3's binding to different ubiquitinated molecules.<p>the reactome pathway shows that upon tnf receptor 1 (tnfr1) stimulation, the e3 ubiquitin ligases such as baculoviral iap repeat-containing protein (birc2/3 or ciap1/2) mediate polyubiquitination of ripk1 generating k63-linked chains. tnfaip3 removes these k63-linked polyubiquitin chains, preventing the interaction of ripk1 with nfkappab essential modulator (nemo). subsequently, tnfaip3 facilitates addition of k48-linked polyubiquitin chains to rip1, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. in this way, tnfaip3 restricts tnf-induced nfkappab signaling by sequential deubiquitination and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ripk1.<p>tnfaip3 (a20) is thought to limit nfkappab activation, however the inhibitory mechanisms for tnfaip3 are not fully understood and are partially contradicting. a study with knockin mice expressing dub-inactive tnfaip3 c103a mutant reported that the deubiquitinase (dub) activity was dispensable for lps- or tnf-stimulated nfkappab signaling. in contrast to tnfaip3 knockout mice that develop perinatal lethality, the knockin tnfaip3 c103a mice were normal and did not have an inflammatory phenotype. these finding are in agreement with an earlier study reporting that the tnfaip3 c103a knockin mice were grossly normal for at least 4 months and contained a normal number of lymphocytes. in addition, bone marrow-derived macrophage cells (bmdm) from the knockin mice showed normal lps- and tnf-induced nfkappab activation and downstream gene expression, comparable to cells from wild-type mice. the study suggests that the deubiquitinase activity of tnfaip3 in general is not obligate for most of the regulatory functions of tnfaip3 and alternative mechanisms might be involved in tnfaip3-mediated nfkappab regulation. indeed, there is biochemical evidence for different

'k48polyub'}",{'k48polyub-ripk1-containing tnfr1 complexes'},"{'ripk1-containg tnfr1 signaling complexes', 'k48polyub', 'k48polyub-ripk1-containing tnfr1 complexes'}","tnfaip3 (a20) is ubiquitin-editing enzyme with distinct peptidase and ligase domains. the amino-terminal domain of tnfaip3 (a20), which is a de-ubiquitinating (dub) enzyme of the otu (ovarian tumour) family, removes k63-linked ubiquitin chains from adaptor proteins such as receptor interacting protein 1 (ripk1). the carboxy-terminal domain of tnfaip3 (a20), composed of seven c2/c2 zinc fingers, functions as a ubiquitin ligase by polyubiquitinating target proteins with k48-linked ubiquitin chains, thereby targeting them for proteasomal degradation. tnfaip3 zinc fingers have been also shown to support tnfaip3's binding to different ubiquitinated molecules.<p>the reactome pathway shows that upon tnf receptor 1 (tnfr1) stimulation, the e3 ubiquitin ligases such as baculoviral iap repeat-containing protein (birc2/3 or ciap1/2) mediate polyubiquitination of ripk1 generating k63-linked chains. tnfaip3 removes these k63-linked polyubiquitin chains, preventing the interaction of ripk1 with nfkappab essential modulator (nemo). subsequently, tnfaip3 facilitates addition of k48-linked polyubiquitin chains to rip1, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. in this way, tnfaip3 restricts tnf-induced nfkappab signaling by sequential deubiquitination and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of ripk1.<p>tnfaip3 (a20) is thought to limit nfkappab activation, however the inhibitory mechanisms for tnfaip3 are not fully understood and are partially contradicting. a study with knockin mice expressing dub-inactive tnfaip3 c103a mutant reported that the deubiquitinase (dub) activity was dispensable for lps- or tnf-stimulated nfkappab signaling. in contrast to tnfaip3 knockout mice that develop perinatal lethality, the knockin tnfaip3 c103a mice were normal and did not have an inflammatory phenotype. these finding are in agreement with an earlier study reporting that the tnfaip3 c103a knockin mice were grossly normal for at least 4 months and contained a normal number of lymphocytes. in addition, bone marrow-derived macrophage cells (bmdm) from the knockin mice showed normal lps- and tnf-induced nfkappab activation and downstream gene expression, comparable to cells from wild-type mice. the study suggests that the deubiquitinase activity of tnfaip3 in general is not obligate for most of the regulatory functions of tnfaip3 and alternative mechanisms might be involved in tnfaip3-mediated nfkappab regulation. indeed, there is biochemical evidence for different mechanisms that may contribute to tnfaip3 inhibitory effects on tnfr1 pro-inflammatory signaling in a cell type-dependent manner:<ul><li>deubiquitination of k63-linked ubiquitin chains from ripk1 by the otu domain and adding of k48-linked polyubiquitin chains via its forth zinc finger (znf4) domain.</li><li>triggering degradation of e2 enzymes such as ubiquitin conjugating enzyme ubc13 by adding k48-linked polyubiquitin chains and disruption of interactions between e2 and e3 (birc2,3 or traf2) enzymes in the tnfr1 pathway. this event was impaired with dub-inactive tnfaip3 (c103a, within the otu domain) suggesting that there might be a crosstalk with dub-dependent mechanisms.</li><li>a non-catalytic blockage of tak1-mediated ikk activation by tnfaip3 binding to polyubiquitin chain via its seventh zinc finger (znf7) and forming a complex involving specific nemo:tnfaip3 interaction. </li><li>a non-catalytic

2804,Beginning of RNA Polymerase III Productive Transcription,"the transition from abortive to productive transcription may occur at bp +5. the primary transcripts of pol iii-transcribed genes are short, ~90 to 120 nt for trna and 5 srna genes (which constitute the great majority of products) and even the longest transcripts (e.g. the rna of the signal recognition particles) are only ~500 nt. the special feature of this transcription is the presence of initiation factors bound within the transcription unit - tfiiia within class 1 genes (nh section) and tfiiic in class 1 and class 2 genes. transcript elongation, which has been analyzed at single-step resolution on a single sc trna gene, is rapid with highly purified components (tfiiic, tfiiib and pol iii), and also in crude extracts. in particular, tfiiic does not present a barrier to transcript elongation, generating a delay at only a single site of only 0.15-0.2 s duration at 20c. in other words, the requirement to displace tfiiic during transcript elongation is not rate-limiting for trna gene activity. on the other hand, transcript elongation slows down when short u-tracts, e.g. uuu, are laid down, even at high concentrations of ntps. these pauses exceed the tfiiic-imposed delay on transcription of the sc sup4 gene by a factor of ~3 or greater.<p>sc tfiiic is entirely displaced from a trna gene during multiple cycles of transcription in vitro and its occupancy of pol iii genes in vivo during active cell growth is also low.","{'rna polymerase iii open sup4 trnatyr promoter complex', 'elongating pre-rna pol iii oligonucleotide'}","{'elongating pre-rna pol iii transcript', 'rna polymerase iii sup4 trnatyr gene transcription complex', 'sup4 trna promoter complex'}","{'elongating pre-rna pol iii oligonucleotide', 'rna polymerase iii open sup4 trnatyr promoter complex', 'elongating pre-rna pol iii transcript', 'rna polymerase iii sup4 trnatyr gene transcription complex', 'sup4 trna promoter complex'}","the transition from abortive to productive transcription may occur at bp +5. the primary transcripts of pol iii-transcribed genes are short, ~90 to 120 nt for trna and 5 srna genes (which constitute the great majority of products) and even the longest transcripts (e.g. the rna of the signal recognition particles) are only ~500 nt. the special feature of this transcription is the presence of initiation factors bound within the transcription unit - tfiiia within class 1 genes (nh section) and tfiiic in class 1 and class 2 genes. transcript elongation, which has been analyzed at single-step resolution on a single sc trna gene, is rapid with highly purified components (tfiiic, tfiiib and pol iii), and also in crude extracts. in particular, tfiiic does not present a barrier to transcript elongation, generating a delay at only a single site of only 0.15-0.2 s duration at 20c. in other words, the requirement to displace tfiiic during transcript elongation is not rate-limiting for trna gene activity. on the other hand, transcript elongation slows down when short u-tracts, e.g. uuu, are laid down, even at high concentrations of ntps. these pauses exceed the tfiiic-imposed delay on transcription of the sc sup4 gene by a factor of ~3 or greater.<p>sc tfiiic is entirely displaced from a trna gene during multiple cycles of transcription in vitro and its occupancy of pol iii genes in vivo during active cell growth is also low."
